# Group 2 foundations blog website.
The goal of this application was to demonstrate the practical use of Flask in building a CRUD application that allowed us to :
Authenticate all users by providing `login`and `registration`features(username, password)_Register with (username and password)
Authenticated users should be able to login and create blog posts where they write about their foundation's learnings and share it for others to see.

## Project Layout
All of our projects live in the `foundations`directory. This directory holds our `virtual environment`and our `blog application`proper. The `templates folder`within our blog directory, found in the root foundations folder is where all of our HTML code for the UI live while the `static`folder holds our CSS and images(if we decide to add any)
We have added a `test/`directory as we hope to include tests if we have time for it during the final part of the course.
